A force-directed graph helper for d3.js.

Takes the repetition out of setting up an SVG-based force-directed graph in d3:
- only customize the parts that matter for your graph
- control force settings through dat.gui

Adds some capabilities and helpers:
- easily modify the node and edge arrays without worrying
- measure statistical metadata like eigenvector centrality

**Requirements**
- [d3.js](http://d3js.org)
- [Sylvester.js](http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/) for linear algebra
- [dat.gui](http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage) for GUI settings helper

_Examples coming soon._
